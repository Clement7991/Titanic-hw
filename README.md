# Titanic

## Should you board ?

This is what this tiny project attempts to answer.

To do so, it predicts whether you are likely to survive the sinking of the cruise ship.

The app requires the following information to predict the outcome of your trip on the Titanic:

* Passenger ID
* Ticket class
* Name
* Sex
* Age
* Number of siblings / spouses aboard
* Number of parents / children aboard
* Ticket number
* Passenger Fare
* Cabin number
* Port of embarkation
