# Titanic

## Should you board ?

Imagine this is 1912.

You just bought a ticket to board the biggest cruise ship ever made.

Although you aren't a fan of being on the sea or in the water, you were told this ship was unsinkable.

But is it ?

This project is based on a kaggle competitition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data) and attempts to answer whether you are right to fear water or not.

More specifically, it predicts whether you are likely to survive the sinking of the unsinkable.

Indicate the following information and let the app do the rest:

* Ticket class
* Name
* Sex
* Age
* Number of siblings / spouses aboard
* Number of parents / children aboard
* Ticket number
* Passenger Fare
* Cabin number
* Port of embarkation

Try it out and predict the outcome of your trip on the Titanic.
